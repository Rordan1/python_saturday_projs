Other examples are federal or state grants for community development, urban renewal, or other needs.\n",
        "\n",

        "Business and Corporate: As part of their social responsibility and commitment to the communities that they do business in, many companies offer grant opportunities. Larger corporations may have subsidiary foundations or internal application review panels who will distribute grant funds to nonprofits working in their focus areas. Most corporations will have information about these opportunities on their websites. With larger companies, it is often helpful to contact a local office or branch.\n"
